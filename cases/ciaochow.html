        <p class="description">COLLEGE students often choose to cook for themselves or meal prep ahead of
          time to save money and time. In order to “enhance health,” we asked three
          college students to cook a meal only using ingredients that they already had
           in their kitchen in order to observe problems they face while prepping and
           cooking a meal. </p>
        <p class="interviewee">Lauren:</p>
        <p class="description">Since Lauren always meal preps, she did not
           want to waste food in order to complete the task. Lauren’s meals
           do not vary throughout the week, even if she wants to eat something
            else. While meal prepping at the beginning of the week is cost
            efficient, the meals are limited in scope.</p>
        <p class="interviewee">Vivian:</p>
        <p class="description">Vivian typically eats frozen foods from Costco,
           and her apartment mates share produce. In a normal trip to Costco,
            Vivian and her apartment spend about $150. She says it’s cheaper
             to buy in bulk, but there is more pressure to eat the food since
              there is more food but the expiration date does not change. Vivian
              says that she has a lot of food waste for items that are not frozen, even with sharing food with her apartment mates.	</p>

        <p class="interviewee">Ava:</p>
        <p class="description">In terms of cooking, Ava says she generally tries
          to meal prep 1-2x per week. She has made it a goal this quarter to not buy
           food on campus because although it’s convenient, it is very expensive.
           So far, she has not eaten on campus. Sometimes she carries the food
            to campus, but if she wasn’t prepared to be on campus so late, she
             stays hungry until she gets home and can get food. Currently this
              is okay because she has control over finding time in her school
              schedule to come home and cook, but she knows that later in the
              quarter she won’t have this much control. </p>
        <p class="description">BASED off of the interviews, we identified the following user needs:</p>
        <ol class="description">
          <li>College students need to be able to save food items that are bought
            in bulk because buying in bulk can be a beneficial, cost-effective
            option but tends to lead to a lot of food waste</li>
          <li>College students need an accessible way to meal share to optimize
          the amount of servings they’ve made of a meal, because prepped meals
          often go to waste due to large quantities that expire before they are
           all eaten.</li>
          <li>College students need access to simple and easy recipes that are quick
             to make amidst their busy schedule.</li>
          <li>College students need to be able to find last minute cheap and
          healthy meal options when they are unable to cook.</li>
          <li>College students need an alternative way to throwing away unused food,
          because food items that are still edible but no longer wanted nor needed are
           wasted if thrown away. </li>
        </ol>

         <p class="description">BELOW are three storyboards derived from the
         user needs listed above.</p>

       <div class="prototype">
         <p class="header">Paper Prototyping</p>
         <p class="description">BASED off of our storyboards, we chose to focus
         on the user need of reducing food waste. Below is a proposed paper prototype
         of an app that allows students to share their food. Factors on searching for
        food include mutual time & location, food type (prepared, packaged, or produce),
        and finally preference.</p>

        <p class="header">Wireframes</p>
        <p class="description">AFTER paper prototyping, we wanted to prototype two pages
        of the app in somewhat higher fidelity. The home page prompts users to choose whether
        they are looking to pick up or drop off food. The decision page is an example of
        a food item that would appear in a user's search for pick up. Below are wireframes
        for both of these pages.</p>
